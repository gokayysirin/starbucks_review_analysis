Starbucks Reviews Dataset - NLP Analysis
This repository contains a dataset of Starbucks customer reviews and an accompanying Jupyter Notebook that performs Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis on the dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze customer reviews for Starbucks to uncover insights about customer sentiment, identify recurring themes, and determine areas of improvement. Using Natural Language Processing techniques, we analyze the textual data to classify sentiments and visualize key findings.

File Structure
reviews_data.csv: The dataset containing Starbucks customer reviews. Each row includes a customer review and other relevant details such as ratings or timestamps (if available).
starbucks_nlp.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and NLP techniques. It includes data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization.
Installation and Requirements
To run the notebook and replicate the results, you'll need the following tools and libraries:

Python Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
nltk or spaCy: For NLP preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models such as sentiment classification.
wordcloud: To generate word clouds for visualizing frequent words in reviews.
Tools:
Jupyter Notebook: To run the .ipynb file.
Installation:
You can install the necessary Python libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn wordcloud
How to Use
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <https://github.com/gokayysirin/starbucks_review_analysis>
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd Starbucks_Reviews_Dataset
Install the required Python libraries if not already installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook starbucks_nlp.ipynb
Run the cells in the notebook to:

Load the dataset.
Preprocess and clean the reviews.
Perform sentiment analysis.
Generate visualizations of the results.
Key Features of the Notebook
Data Cleaning: Removes missing values, punctuation, and stopwords to prepare the data for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Uses NLP libraries and machine learning models to classify the reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
Visualization:
Word Clouds for frequent terms in reviews.
Bar plots and pie charts for sentiment distribution.
Insights Extraction: Highlights key insights from customer reviews to help Starbucks improve its services.
Example Workflow
Input: Customer reviews from the reviews_data.csv file.
Processing:
Data cleaning.
Tokenization and lemmatization of reviews.
Sentiment classification using a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes).
Output:
A sentiment distribution graph showing the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral reviews.
A Word Cloud highlighting commonly used terms in customer feedback.
Future Improvements
Implement advanced NLP models like BERT or GPT for more accurate sentiment classification.
Add topic modeling (e.g., LDA) to identify themes in customer reviews.
Explore multilingual support for reviews written in different languages.
